# Sensu cookbook changelog

This file is used to track changes made in recent versions of the Sensu
cookbook. Please see HISTORY.md for changes from older versions of this project.

## [Unreleased]

## [3.0.0] - 2016-08-09

### Important

This cookbook now supports Chef version 12+. Earlier versions may work but
are not supported.

The default version of Sensu installed by this cookbook is now 0.25.6-1.

The default value of `node["sensu"]["use_embedded_ruby"]` is now `true`.

The `rabbitmq` recipe now installs Erlang via the Erlang Solutions repository on all platforms.

### Behavior changes

Installation of the .NET Framework is now handled by the [ms_dotnet](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/ms_dotnet) cookbook.

### Features

Sensu Enterprise repository URL is now configurable via attributes.

Sensu Enterprise JVM options are now configurable via attributes.

Sensu transport `name` is now configurable via attributes.

The `sensu_base_config` provider now honors `node["rabbitmq"]["hosts"]` attribute,
providing an array of hosts to use for configuring rabbitmq transport with multiple brokers.
When `hosts` attribute has no value, we fall back to value of `node["sensu"]["rabbitmq"]["host"]`
attribute.

The `sensu_client` provider now honors the following additional client
attributes, as defined in the [Sensu Client Reference Documentation](https://sensuapp.org/docs/0.25/reference/clients.html#client-attributes):

* deregister
* deregistration
* keepalives
* redact
* registration
* safe_mode
* socket

Check definition LWRP has been updated to support named aggregates (added
in Sensu 0.25) and multiple named aggregates (coming in Sensu 0.26).

Integration tests for Windows now use the new Chef Zero Scheduled
Task provider which makes testing this platform much easier.

Expanded unit tests in many areas, including `sensu_base_config`,
`sensu_client`, `sensu_json_file` and other LWRPs.

### Fixes

Directories created by the `sensu_json_file` provider now assume the mode
defined by the value of `node["sensu"]["directory_mode"]` attribute.

The method used to look up `sensu_service_trigger` ruby block in the
resource collection has been updated to eliminate conditions where Sensu
services may not be notified to restart.

Resources are now created by the `sensu_json_file` provider
unconditinally, unblocking the use of library cookbooks like [zap](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/zap) to
clean up unmanaged files on disk.


## [2.12.0] - 2016-03-14

### Project changes

The Sensu cookbook project has adopted a new contribution workflow and a
new code of conduct policy. Please see the relevant documents in
repo for details.

### Behavior changes

Values for `owner` and `group` properties on `sensu_json_file` resources
now default to lazy evaluation of node attributes `sensu.admin_user` and
`sensu.group` respectively. (#426)

Data bags remain default source of SSL certificates, but are now optional:

	With the addition of Sensu state helpers in #410 recipes which
	access credentials via data bags (i.e. `default`, `rabbitmq` and
	`enterprise` recipes) have been updated to make these data bag
	items optional.

	Please see the readme and integration test suite for examples of
	using these helpers.

Testing notes have been added in `TESTING.md` to describe some of the
platform/suite combinations which are disabled or otherwise
require special configuration.

### Features

Added [ChefSpec](https://github.com/sethvargo/chefspec) test coverage for the following:

* `default` and `client_service` recipes
* `sensu_gem` LWRP
* Sensu::Helpers library `#select_attributes` and `#gem_binary`  methods

Added source attribute to sensu_gem resource
Added upgrade action to sensu_gem resource
Added helpers for storing key/value pairs which persist for duration of the Chef run

### Fixes

Allow "standard" as a value of type attribute on `sensu_check` resources, [as described in Sensu documentation](https://sensuapp.org/docs/0.21/checks).
